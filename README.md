Descriprion:
# eSuite
Program that solves numerically algebraic systems of non-linear, and linear, equations where one only has to write down the equations to obtain the results. It also includes a database of thermodynamical properties for many substances and a symbolic mathematical program to perform mathematical operations. Basically the program is an open source clone of the EES but written in Java.

# Open source and multiplatform equation solver
The purpose of this project is to create a fully functional program that allows the user to solve systems of non-linear equations, more concretely engineering type equations. Also, it includes a data base of thermodynamical properties of several substances: steam, air, nitrogen, argon, butane, propane,...

# Features
Solves systems of non-linear algebraic equation in an easy way. For example:

For solving the second newton law you only have to introduce the following code: F = M * A /*It includes trigonometric, hiperbolic, logarithms and exponential functions*/ M = 2 * 2 + 1 - 1 + sin(Pi) + sinh(2.7) A = 2^2*(exp(2/3)+log(1))

Calling a thermodynamic property in the program, it includes validity range and reliable information: /**Temperature: Kelvin. Cp: Kj/(Kg*Kelvin) Average error: 0.24 Validity: 273 to 1500*/ Butane.Cp(Cp, Temperature) /*You can change the name of the variables Cp and temperature, but the order must be the same*/ Temperature = 700
